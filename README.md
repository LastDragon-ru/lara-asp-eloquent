This package contains useful extensions and mixins for [Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).


# Installation

```shell
composer require lastdragon-ru/lara-asp-eloquent
```

# Iterators

Iterators are similar to `Builder::chunk()` but uses generators instead of `\Closure` that makes code more readable:

```php
$query = \App\Models\User::query();

$query->chunk(100, function ($users) {
    foreach ($users as $user) {
        // ...
    }
});

foreach ($query->getChunkedIterator() as $user) {
    // ...
}
```

Iterators also support limit/offset, by default it will try to get them from the Builder, but you can also set them by hand:

```php
$query = \App\Models\User::query()->offset(10)->limit(20);

foreach ($query->getChunkedIterator() as $user) {
    // ... 20 items from 10 
}

foreach ($query->getChunkedIterator()->setOffset(0) as $user) {
    // ...20 items from 0
}
```

When you use the default [`ChunkedIterator`](./src/Iterators/ChunkedIterator.php) you should not modify/delete the items while iteration or you will get unexpected results (eg missing items). If you need to modify/delete items while iteration you can use [`ChunkedChangeSafeIterator`](./src/Iterators/ChunkedChangeSafeIterator.php) that specially created for this case and unlike standard `chunkById()` it is always safe (please see https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/35400 for more details). But there are few limitations:

- it is not possible to sort rows, they always will be sorted by `column asc`;
- the `column` should not be changed while iteration or this may lead to repeating row in results;
- the row inserted while iteration may be skipped if it has `column` with the value that lover than the internal pointer;
- queries with UNION is not supported;
- `offset` from Builder will not be used;

To create a change safe instance you can use:

```php
$query = \App\Models\User::query();

foreach ($query->getChangeSafeIterator() as $user) {
    // ...
}
```
